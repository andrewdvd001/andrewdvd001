'''Task 5: Practice File Handling
Objective: Create a Python program that manages a to-do list by saving it to a file and reading from it.

Instructions:

1. Create a list of tasks (e.g., ["Buy groceries", "Study Python", "Call friend"]).
2. Define a function save_tasks(filename, tasks) that saves each task to a file (one task per line).
3. Define a function read_tasks(filename) that reads the tasks from the file and returns them as a list.
4. Write a program that:
    Saves the task list to a file (e.g., todo.txt).
    Reads the tasks from the file and prints them.
    Appends a new task (e.g., "Exercise") to the file.
    Reads and prints the updated task list.
5. Bonus (Optional): Add error handling to read_tasks to handle FileNotFoundError and return an empty list if the file doesnâ€™t exist.
